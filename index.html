          <h1>Introduction</h1>
        </div>
       </div>
      <p>Hi. I am Javad, a bartender living in Kuala lumpur, Malaysia. I am a fan of music, travel and innovation. I'm also interested in wagering and DIY.</p>
      <p>Well that was what a website made a default intro about me according to my interests and tastes. So who am I really? My all time favorite question.</p>
      <p>I am a 21 year-old asylum seeker living in KL, Malaysia. I passionately learn new things until I master them and challenge myself every day. </p>
      <p>According to me... if nobody is against you, then you are doing something very boring. </p>
      <p>I'm not at all filmy or dramatic. I like getting straight to the point. I either have a fight or be awesomely cool with you. Hanging in between is not my thing.</p>
      <p>I love giving more than my best only if interested, and one of the things that I've been more than interested in since long ago has been coding which due to the problems that I was facing either in Iran (where I was born ) or Malaysia as an asylum seeker,that prevented me from learning and exploring it. Now thanks to <a href="https://recodemalaysia.com/" target="_blank">

      RECODE</a> I have the opportunity to learn how to code and have a head-start to the programming world...</p>
      <p>I'm kind of person who sees everything in codes. When I use a lift all I think about is when I press the button what happens? How is it programmed to take me upstairs or the opposite.</p>
      <p>When I'm amazed by beautiful water fountain in KLCC Park that dances so harmonically with the song and the colors make it even more spectacular what my mind keeps asking is how is it programmed? How can everything be so exact and matched together?</p>
      <p>When I look around everything is coded and programmed maybe with different kinds of ordering but it's all part of the programming world that I love...</p>
      <p>I hope someday I can show this one-pager website so proud to everyone and tell them this was my first project and I tried more than my best to be one of the twenties. Even though I was working more than 14 hours a day in a tea bar.</p>

       <h1>5 Reason That Makes Me Love Coding</h1>
       </div>
       <h3>Reason #1: I love to code because it is usable art.</h3>
       <div class="imageAlign">
       <img src="./img/10.jpg" alt="Code is usable art" class="black-border">
       </div>
       <p>Just like architecture, which is an art used by people daily and affects their everyday life, so is code. You can create something and people interact with, use, touch and work with. That is an amazing feeling.</p>
       <h3>Reason #2: I love to code because it is a team effort.</h3>
       <div class="imageAlign">
       <img src="./img/11.jpg" alt="It is a team effort" class="black-border">
       </div>
       <p>Since code is a usable art, a whole team of people are connected to the practice. From the client to the account managers, and including the business people, finance, the support team, QA team, designers, product managers and project managers. Code touches every single person in the organization and makes a difference to every single user that touches it (for good or bad).</p>
       <h3>Reason #3: I love to code since it makes a difference in peoples’ lives.</h3>
       <div class="imageAlign">
       <img src="./img/12.jpg" alt="it makes a difference in peoples’ lives" class="black-border">
       </div>
       <p>When I manage to build something that saves people time and prevents them from doing tedious tasks, I know that I am making a difference in that person’s life. They now have more time to be with their kids, more time to think up ideas (something computers cannot) and more time to connect to people.</p>
       </div>
       <h3>Reason #4: I love to code because if I can think it, I can make it a reality.</h3>
       <div class="imageAlign">
       <img src="./img/13.jpg" alt="I can make it a reality." class="black-border">
       </div>
       <p>In programming if you can consistently create a logic that interacts with the other parts of the computer and other applications you can make it happen. All you need to do after you thought it up is actually write it and presto a new thing is created into the world. That really feels like being a wizard.
Unlike physics where physical restraints are in everything you do, there are no limitations in coding besides your ability to think of a logically consistent solution. When writing an application you do not need to think about the strength of the material, what will happen when there is wear and tear or how you will reach an element to fix it 3 years down the road. It is virtual in a good sense and everything that comes with it.</p>
      <h3>Reason #5: I love to code because it is fun.</h3>
      <div class="imageAlign">
      <img src="./img/14.jpg" alt="it is fun." class="black-border">
      </div>
      <p>The sense of accomplishment when solving a really complicated problem cannot be beat! It just feels as if you have been at the best party in town...</p>
